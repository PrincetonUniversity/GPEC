- Found elliptic integrals from python inconsistent with k^2 convention
in NTV formulae. Need to use k^2 in all arguments.

- Changed IPEC xsp1_mn in ipeq.f to be direct integral of xsp, as poorly
conditioned ITER matrices where causing waves in direct calc.

- natorq gen calculation theta loop now includes test for 
local magnetic wells (cases of max(B[bounce1:bounce2])>B_bounce).
