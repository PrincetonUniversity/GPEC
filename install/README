Installation
===============

Using a stable release, the user should set the environment variable GPEC_PLATFORM to the appropriate tag for their architecture and fortran 90 compiler. For example, at PPPL this might be done using::

  export GPEC_PLATFORM=PPPL_LFF95

The tag should match a make.inc file in the install directory, which sets a number of make variables defining compiler types and library paths. Not the appropriate compiler must be in the users path. Instructions for adding the compiler can be found in each make.inc file. For example, if using the Lahey64 compiler at PPPL the user must have executed::

  module load lff95

With the GPEC_PLATFORM variable set and the compiler in the users path, the package exicutables can be made from the source code from the package root using::

  make -f makefile_platform
  
The exicutables will then be available in their individual subdirectories as well as collected in the bin directory.
