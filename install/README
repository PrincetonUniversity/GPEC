Install
========

Public installations should be downloaded and kept up to date from the releases on Github. The releases remain private for now, so only those with access to the repository will be able to install/update the site package.

The global makefile can be found in the install directory. This essentially enters and makes each individual subdirectory. Each subdirectory's makefile references the make.inc file, also in install. A basic compiling is as simple as executing::

  make
  
in the install directory. The exicutables will then be available in their individual subdirectories as well as collected in the bin directory.

The make.inc sets a number of variables based on conditionals that determine the archetecture on which GPEC is being compiled. If you are installing in a new or recently changed environment these can be over-riden at the individual level. For example, at PPPL this might be done in pentrc using::

  make FC=lfc

The executable then must be manually copied to the package bin directory.
