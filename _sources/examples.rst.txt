This section provides some useful tutorial examples for running the GPEC package codes together to produce relevant, publication worthy results.

OMFIT Tutorial
==============

`OMFIT <http://gafusion.github.io/OMFIT-source/>`_ is a framework for integrated modeling. It contains a GPEC module for preparing, running, and analyzing GPEC runs that is highly recommended for pure users (non-developers).
Public releases of OMFIT are available on most major fusion clusters, or it can be downloaded to your personal computer.

A very thorough tutorial going over the workflow, inputs, and output visualization is available in `this google doc tutorial <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSUjJZYmET8-X08rRGBT6L_9D9fzEN_zCV75OX_ZbZk/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
One of the major benefits to a new user is the pre-packaged post-analysis and plotting. These provide an intuitive assessment of the run quality and basic results.


Manual Examples
=================

The GPEC repository contains a number of examples intended to provide both consistent regression testing and a useful reseource for users looking to manually run straightforward examples. These examples are located in $GPECHOME/docs/examples, and contain all the necessary inputs and namelists to run the appropriate suite of codes. Ideal and kinetic examples use dcon, gpec, and pentrc. Resistive examples contain the necessary inputs to run dcon, rdcon, rmatch and gpec.

Example console commands and output are given below.

.. note:: The use of $GPECHOME and executable commands such as `dcon`, `gpec` or `pentrc` assumes the appropriate environement variables have been set. The easiest way to do this is to use the module commands associated with one of the public installations.
