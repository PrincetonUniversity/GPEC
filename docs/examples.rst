This section provides some useful tutorial examples for running the GPEC package codes together to produce relevant, publication worthy results.

OMFIT Tutorial
==============

`OMFIT <http://gafusion.github.io/OMFIT-source/>`_ is a framework for integrated modeling. It contains a GPEC module for preparing, running, and analyzing GPEC runs that is highly recommended for pure users (non-developers).
Public releases of OMFIT are available on most major fusion clusters, or it can be downloaded to your personal computer.

A very thorough tutorial going over the workflow, inputs, and output visualization is available in `this google doc tutorial <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSUjJZYmET8-X08rRGBT6L_9D9fzEN_zCV75OX_ZbZk/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
One of the major benefits to a new user is the pre-packaged post-analysis and plotting. These provide an intuitive assessment of the run quality and basic results.
