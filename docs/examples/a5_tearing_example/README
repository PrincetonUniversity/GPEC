This is an example showing how to use RDCON and RMATCH to find tearing mode growth rate.
Summary of workflow:
../../../bin/rdcon
../../../bin/rmatch

In rdcon.in, it is essential to set
gal_flag=t        #turn on delta' calucation
coil%rpec_flag=f  #turn off computation of resistive response
Note: rpect_flag = t RDCON will prepare the solution for the computation of resistive plasma response.

Then, run
../../../bin/rdcon

You can check delta prime here.

 PEST3 matching data real part:
  i   j  Aij        Bij        Gammaij    Deltaij
  1   1  2.363E+03  1.393E+03  1.640E+03  1.290E+01

Deltaij is real part of delta prime

In rmatch, the parameters related to inner region should be set.
msing (type:int scalar, number of singular sufaces included for matching)
initguess (type: complex scalar, init value of eigenvalue for root finder)
eta (type: real array, resistivity for each singular surface)
massden (type: real array, mass density for each singular surface)
Now, run rmatch
../../../bin/rmatch

The result should be
Eigenvalue=  9.391E+00  4.133E-01
