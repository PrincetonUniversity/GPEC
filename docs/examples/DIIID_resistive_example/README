The example is used to show how to show the workflow of getting resistive response.

Note: rpect_flag = t needs to be set in rdcon.in to run resistive plasma response.
It generates the independent resistive and ideal solutions for rmatch and gpec.
rmatch is used to combined ideal and resistive solution to provide mpert individual resistive solutions for gpec run
gpec couples mpert resistive soluitons to the coils for getting final resistive response.
