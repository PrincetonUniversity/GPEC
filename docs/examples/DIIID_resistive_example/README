The example is used to show how to show the workflow of getting resistive response.

Note: rpec_flag = t needs to be set in rdcon.in to run resistive plasma response.
It generates the independent resistive and ideal solutions for rmatch and gpec.
RMATCH combines ideal and resistive solutions from RDCON, providing mpert individual resistive solutions for the GPEC run.
GPEC then couples the mpert resistive solutions to the coils to get the resistive plasma response to the applied field.
