    coil_threads=0              ! Number of parallel threads used when computing fields from coils (no reason to go beyond 4 for coils with less than 1000 points). Setting <=0 defaults to OMP_NUM_THREADS env variable. Setting to <= 0 uses OMP_NUM_THREADS env variable.

! Array values should be specified for each of the coil arrays to be activated.
