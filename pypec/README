Log for developement of pypec python package.

See  http://nstx-u.pppl.gov/software for documentation.



################################ KNOWN ISSUES & BUGS

 - As a hack, "q" is not accepted as an x-axis (necessary to get correct
dimensionality when output besides psi). "Lambda" is always accepted as
an axis is available.

 - Should add a stop to run if DCON dW is negative.

 - gpec.run qsub currently only suports bash environment

 - leaves trail of .oe files... should add option to clean these up.
